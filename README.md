# bike-fit-vis
A simple tool that uses bike frame and person length measurements to visualise the user on a bike, and calculate current angles as the crank moves through a revolution. This allows multiple riders to be overlaid and plotted in different positions, to compare the effect of adjusting seat height and position.

# Setup
There are two main configuration files, one for the bike, and one for the rider. The rider file allows multiple rider configurations to be set.
## bike.json
This defines the dimensions of the bike. "Required for rider" determines whether the length has an effect on the rider angles.

| Parameter Name | Required for Rider | Description                                                                                                |

## rider.json
This can define multiple riders. Each rider must have the following defined.

| Parameter Name         | Required for Rider | Description                                                                   |

| seatLengthAft          | Yes                | The length of the seat behind the seatpost.                                   |
| seatRiderOffsetX       | Yes                | The horizontal offset of the rider hip joint from the seat/seatpost position. |
| seatRiderOffsetY       | Yes                | The vertical offset of the rider hip joint from the seat/seatpost position.   |
| hip2ShoulderLength     | Yes                | The distance between the hip joint point and the shoulder joint point.        |
| hip2KneeLength         | Yes                | The distance from the hip joint to the knee joint. |

| footContactProportion  | Yes                | The proportion from the rear of the foot that the foot contacts the middle of the pedal. |
| pedalLength            | Yes                | The Length of the pedal. |

# Use
Update both bike.json and rider.json with your configurations, then run

```
python main.py
```

This allows the user to visualise the position through the crank cycle, and compare the maximum and minimum knee and hip angles for each configuration.
